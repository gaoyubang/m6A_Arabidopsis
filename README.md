Functional analysis of m6A sites in Arabidopsis thaliana
=========

This folder contains results involving a functional analysis of m6A methylation in
Arabidopsis thaliana.

 - m6A methylation data is based on [Luo et al.](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141128/ncomms6630/abs/ncomms6630.html)
 - Polyadenylation cluster (PAC) sites are based on [Wu et al.](www.pnas.org/content/108/30/12533.long)
 - Cleavage sites are based on [Sherstnev et al.](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v19/n8/full/nsmb.2345.html)

All functional analyses and visualisations were performed using [RNAModR](https://github.com/mevers/RNAModR).
